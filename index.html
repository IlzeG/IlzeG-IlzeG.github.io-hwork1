        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Pomeranian got its name from the region of Pomerania, which is now the area of Germany 
                and Poland, where it was developed from the ancient Spitz breeds. </p>
            <p>The original Pomeranians were much larger, weighing up to 30 pounds, and worked as sheep 
                herders.</p>
            <p>Marie Antoinette, Emile Zola, Mozart and Queen Victoria all owned Pomeranians. </p>
            <p>In 1870 the Kennel Club in England first recognized them as a breed. In 1888 Queen 
                Victoria began breeding and showing the dogs. It was she who started breeding them down 
                in size, making the breed very popular in England. </p>
            <p>The Pomeranian was first recognized by the AKC in 1888. Some of the Pom's talents include: 
                watchdog, agility and performing tricks. Poms make superior circus performers.</p>
            <p>Characteristically spirited but docile, the Pomeranian is a 
            compactly built dog with a foxlike head and small, erect ears. Its long coat, especially full 
            on the neck and chest, may be any of a variety of colours:
            <ul>
                <li>white,</li>
                <li>black,</li>
                <li>brown,</uli>
                <li>reddish brown.</li>
                </ul> </p> 
           <p>Height: 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm).</p>
               <p>Weight: about 3 to 7 pounds (1.5 to 3 kg).</p>

    <h3>Living Conditions</h3>   
    <ol>
    <li>The Pomeranian is good for apartment living. These dogs are very active indoors and will do okay 
    without a yard. Be careful they do not overheat in hot weather.</li>
  <li>Poms need a daily walk. Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, but remember, play will not
      fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that do not get to go on daily walks 
      are more likely to display behavior problems.</li>
      <li>Pomeranians are prone to dislocated patella (kneecap), slipped stifle, heart problems, eye infections, 
          skin irritations and tooth decay and early loss.</li>
          <li>It is recommended that they are fed dry dog food or crunchy Milk Bones daily to help keep the 
              teeth and gums in good condition.</li>
              </ol> </br>
